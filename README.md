# PDA-Clustering_Analysis
Use K- means clustering to target the right segment in the market

We use K means clustering for our analysis given its ease to compute clusters and its efficiency of handling large number of cases better than wards's methods or hierarchical clustering. Based on lifestyle and business needs, the customers demanding PDA have been divided into 4 segments. We can evaluate the different segment attractiveness in terms of:

Size: The biggest segment is segment 1(small businesses), followed by segment 3(mobile professionals)), segment 2 (Innovators) and segment 4 (Front Line) which is the smallest segment
Growth: Segment 4 is small, but may have potential, as they are willing to pay for PDAs with their features at a high price, on average, and most customers in this segment dont own a PDA.
Competition: Large, high-growth segments may look attractive, but small businesses may find it difficult to compete with the large number of existing suppliers. So, must target segments keeping this in mind.
Segment Saturation: Segment 1 and 3 are slightly saturated ( a lot of people in this segment already own a PDA), but segment 4 in terms of saturation is the least crowded (not many own a PDA)
Fit: The best fit in features and needs is with segments 1 and 2
Relationships with other segments: Segments 1 and 2 overlap ( have similarities in many attributes)
Profitability: Segment 4 is willing to pay more for the features that ConneCtor offers.
